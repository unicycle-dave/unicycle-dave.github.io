				My name is Dave Cox, and this summer, I'm embarking on a 9200-km trip across Canada. I'll be riding from Victoria, BC to St. John's, NL over the course of about four months, starting in May and ending (roughly!) at the end of August. During the trip, I'll be filming a feature-length documentary about my adventures, and posting updates here and on my Instagram. <br><br>

				Have you seen me riding? Post your photo with the hashtag #unicycledave on instagram, twitter, or facebook - or send me an email at <a href="mailto:dave@unicycledave.com">dave@unicycledave.com</a>
