It's been an incredible nine days of touring so far. I've seen so much incredible scenery, and met so many friendly and incredible people. The trip has not been without its little challenges, however. At the start, my laptop crashed and needed a windows reset, which means updating this page has been a lot more difficult. I finally have the software reinstalled to lay down a few updates though, so that's really nice! Yay me!

I'm camped out beside the Selkirks right now, listening to the birds and looking out across Kootenay Lake, and I'm just so beside myself with how much fun this tour is (for all the details of my days, definitely check out my instagram feed - it's a lot easier to update, and so it gets the updates!). In the next few days I'll finally be taking a few real rest days in Banff and also to see Jasper with a friend who's going to drive me there. 

Then it's on to the prairies, which for me have always been a totally different headspace than the mountains. The landscape can change so drastically so quickly, and I'm excited to experience it again.

Thanks to all the folks who have put me up, said hi, given me route advice and all the other nice things. It always blows me away how much of that I experience while travelling by unicycle and it's a large part of why I do this kind of touring.
