Well, the day is finally here. I've been planning this for over a year now, and dreaming of it for at least a a decade. This summer, from about May to August, I'll be riding my unicycle (named 1 fast, 1 furious!) from Victoria to St. John's, a 7500km journey and adventure across the country I call home.

I'm expecting good weather and bad, setbacks and breakthroughs, new friends and new experiences - and I can't wait to get going! I'll be flying to Vancouver on May 6th and starting my journey shortly thereafter - but there's lots to do in the meantime to prepare and get ready.

Stay tuned! If you'd like to keep tabs on what I'm up to, check out / follow my instagram feed below, as I'll be posting most of my updates there as well.

Dave
