This is a test update post; there won't ever be much info in these so we're not too worried about having them be too detailed.

Currently I'm looking to get my wheel rolling, and troubleshooting all the little issues that come with putting together something like a touring unicycle (amd associated kit) for the first time. There were some problems with my geared hub in my new frame, but the brake is super feeling nice and I'm hoping in the next few days I can get the video of the whole build cut and colored and uploaded for everyone to enjoy :)
