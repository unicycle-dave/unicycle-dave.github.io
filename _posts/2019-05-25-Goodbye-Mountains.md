As it turned out, I really needed some time off from riding. My time in Jasper was incredible, and it's a beautiful place I am hoping to get back to explore further sometime. The sheer scale of it all is absolutely inspiring and calming, and the side trip was definitely worth it.

Yesterday I crossed the continental divide, which is another milestone in this trip to be sure. Today I'm spending a chill down day in Banff with some family - my original plan was to try and go for a hike as the area is beautiful and full of trails, however it's really, really raining out today. I'm extra glad to not be riding! The weather is looking much better for tomorrow and it's kind of hard to believe that I'll soon be out of the mountains and on to the high prairie. 

The landscape changes super quickly in the next little bit. There's not much warning before you're suddenly out into big sky country - fields as far as the eye can see (which is far!) and the mountains slowly disappearing into the distance.

Over the next few weeks I'm hoping to visit the Alberta Badlands, and make my way south so I can visit Grasslands national park, which is supposed to be absolutely beautiful. With any luck there will be clear skies and I can spend some nights stargazing far away from civilization.

There's a lot more journey to come, and I'm really settled in now for the long haul. The routines and day-to-day of self-supported touring are automatic, and my body has really adjusted to the routine. Early mornings out on the road before traffic when the day is new are just euphoric, and I'm looking forward to many more of them on my ride eastward!
