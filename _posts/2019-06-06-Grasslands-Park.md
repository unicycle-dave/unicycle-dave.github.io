It's been a good few weeks out on the prairie. I love this landscape - sometimes it's so flat and open and there's so much sky it feels like being out on the ocean, except the only thing you're going to drown in is dust.

Days of riding on the carefully fenced-off landscape, often tilled or ranched down to the last inch, has made me want to see what it looks like when we don't take over the land, however, and that's what led me to Grasslands. This place is amazing. The wildlife is plentiful and everywhere - prairie dogs, bison, rattlesnakes and deer. And the stars! The milky way is just the beginning of what you can see, lying out at night in your sleeping bag looking up at the big open sky.

I'm glad I made the side trip to come here - and I'll be making more side trips down the line too, to try and see as many of the amazing places this country has to offer as I make my way across. Soon, I'll be in Manitoba, and then on into the Canadian Shield, which has never been a landscape to excite me, but I am sure there will be reasons to like it!
