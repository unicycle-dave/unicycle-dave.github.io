The past two weeks have been a blur. I've been busy tying up loose ends in Toronto, seeing the folks I've wanted to see before I go, makng time for my partners and doing all the little favours I'd promised to friends but hadn't quite gotten around to.

Two days ago, I arrived in Vancouver, and I've been busy getting the final preparations ready - sewing a few things here and there, re-truing my wheel, seeing friends while I'm in town and enjoying the gorgeous weather (maybe a little too much - I've managed a bit of a sunburn today). 

Already while I've been here, so many folks have offered help and advice. I've found places to stay for the first two nights of my trip, and tomorrow I'll be heading to Victoria, so I can start on Friday. 

I'm excited to settle into the rythm of the road, having all the little things that need doing become routine - packing my bags, setting up camp and tearing it down again, the impermanence of new people and all the help and kindness that you can experience while travelling. 

Two more days until I get rolling! It still doesn't feel real, and I'm waiting for it to kick in. Maybe by the time I'm in the mountains my brain will catch up.
