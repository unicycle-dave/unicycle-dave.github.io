I've been working up to this for a few weeks now, but it's time to make the official announcement - starting on may 6th, I'll be riding my unicycle across canada this summer, from Victoria to St. John's. 

I'll be riding my 36-inch geared unicycle, named '1 fast, 1 furious' an estimated 7500km across the country, and filming a documentary about my experience along the way. I expect it's going to take me around four months to ride the distance (giving me plenty of time for rest breaks!), and I intend to ride an average of 80km a day.

For over a year now I've been picking up gear and preparing myself for this trip - taking time off work, upgrading my unicycle, and finding the right mix of film gear to be both light and functional for my needs.

I'll be carrying a small tent and camping stove as well, ensuring I'm self-sufficient on the road, although where possible I'm hoping to stay with folks to make new friends and see more of this country. 

Updates will primarily be available through my Instagram, but I'll be posting maps of my ride and bigger updates here on my website. 

If you're interested in following along, follow me on insta, twitter, or facebook, or just check back here once in a while!

For now though, it's back to finishing up my gear builds and putting the finishing touches on my equipment before flying to Vancouver to get started!

Dave
